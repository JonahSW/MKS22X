Merge method: Given two sorted arrays, returns a single sorted array containing all of their elements

public static merge(int[] a, int[] b){
	int ta, tb //two ints, each keeps track of the current index in their respective arrays
	
	//compare the two elements at ta and tb, add the largest one to the reultant array, and increment that tracker
	
	//if one tracker reaches the end of its array, add the rest of the second array to the resultant at the end
}

Merge sort: given an array, divides it up into many arrays of length one, and then merges them together

public static merge(int[] array){
	
}

//used if merge wants to be recursive
public static mergeHelp(){
	//breaks array into two sections (i.e. copies them into arrays) and then merges them
	//doing this recursively should sort the array
//you need an end case to deal with wierdly lengthed arrays
}
